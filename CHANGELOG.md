All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Steward `resolve` step: a merged commit names the gap it closed.**
  After `gitsync_sweep` brings a merge home, `run_resolve` reads the merged
  commits' `Gap-Id: <12 hex>` trailers (willows-grove INVARIANTS §11) off the
  `before..after` range of each pulled checkout and calls `gap_resolve` with
  `merged <repo>@<sha>`; `Idea-Id:` trailers are collected into the receipt
  only. Idempotent per (gap, sha) through `gaps_resolved` in the state file;
  a refusal is a line with its reason, never a silent skip; the sweep
  receipt now carries `ranges`. Runs in the loop between sweep and mirror
  and as `willow-bot-steward resolve`. Closes the reader half of gap
  e278ec952b9c (the backlog could not record its own closures).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Drop git URL from optional deps so PyPI accepts the upload; document Nestor
  install for Grove Loki separately.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-12

### Added

- Packaged `willow-bot` / `willow-bot-steward` entrypoints (Apache-2.0).
- Steward PR watch (tick/loop/inbox) ported from willow-mcp `loki_pr_watch*`.
- Draft CI deposits (`ci_outcome`) to local JSONL and optional MCP `store_put`.
- Curated MCP heartbeat (`fleet_health`, `commitment_surface`,
  `human_required_list`, `diagnostic_summary`) — dew clock stays on Kart.
